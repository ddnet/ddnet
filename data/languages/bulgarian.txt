Large layer
== 

You are trying to set the height or width of a layer to more than 1000 tiles. This is actually possible, but only rarely necessary. It may cause the editor to work slower and will result in a larger file size as well as higher memory usage for client and server.

Unused tiles can't be placed by default because they could get a use later and then destroy your map.\n\nActivate the 'Allow unused' setting to be able to place every tile.
