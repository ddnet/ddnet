Welcome to DDNet

DDraceNetwork is a cooperative online game where the goal is for you and your group of tees to reach the finish line of the map. As a newcomer you should start on Novice servers, which host the easiest maps. Consider the ping to choose a server close to you.
== 

Use k key to kill (restart), q to pause and watch other players. See settings for other key binds.
== 

It's recommended that you check the settings to adjust them to your liking before joining a server.
