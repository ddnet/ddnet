# Structure

The `src` folder is structured into several folders as follows:

- android: Platform-specific code for Android systems.
- antibot: Antibot API integration.
- base: Cross-platform abstraction layer. Contains many utility functions and abstracts most platform-specific code. Contains functions for string manipulation, filesystem, time, networking, threading, debugging, secure random etc.
- engine: Game engine. Mostly implements non-gameplay related functionality like graphics, sound, input, higher-level networking etc.
- game: Gameplay related code. Separated into client, server and editor.

- masterping: Tool that collects game server info via an HTTP endpoint and aggregates them.
- @ref mastersrv "mastersrv": The mastersrv maintains a list of all registered DDNet (and Teeworlds) servers.
- rust-bridge: Glue to bridge Rust and C++ code.
- steam: Steam API integration.
- test: Unit tests.
