Prepare for the hardest cooperative 2D precision platformer! Get up to 64
friends together, meet new people from all over the world, and help each
other through thousands of maps! Play with your best friend and beat
worldwide records! You will see the best and worst in your teammates when
they save you from certain death or leave you behind in the dust. We've
developed DDNet for over 9 years now and made it greater than ever! It has
been totally free since development started and will always stay free. It's
also open source, so the entire community is invited to help improve it with
great new ideas!

Collect cool weapons, each with their own purpose, and use them to save your
teammates. Use your grappling hook to climb through tunnels and up
mountains. DDNet requires a lot of skill, coordination and practice. Our
friendly online community will help you fall in love with this unique
cooperative game.

Feeling creative? Custom maps can be built in the editor. An active
community contributes new great maps every month, adding to DDNet's
collection of thousands of maps.

Official DDNet servers run in Germany, Poland, USA, Canada, Russia, China,
South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Chile, Brazil, South Africa and
